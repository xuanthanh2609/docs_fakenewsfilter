## About Fake news
```
+ Fake news is built by us to make it accessible to readers
accurate and verified information from official sources
as well as help readers can stay away from fake news that adversely affect society.

+ Fake news uses Flutter technology to build a cross-platform app that can be used on Android and iOS
flexibly and easily. As for the database, we use Entity framework and SQL server to build the database system.
The information processing part we use ASP .net core 6 and MVC model.
We also built an admin website so that admin can manage the information on it.
Currently the application has been deployed to windows server 2019 and will soon be deployed to google play.
